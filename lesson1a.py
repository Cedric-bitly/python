#We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable.
# Anything that is inside quotes is called a string
message = 'Hello there! Hope you are doing well?'
print(message)

message2 = " Goodbye"
print(message2)


# Concactinating variable- joining two or more outputs together
message3 = message + message2
print(message3)

answer = 1+2
print(answer)

answer = 16-3
print(answer)

# Variables can be named using a number, letter and an underscore. They can start with a letter and an underscore but not witha number

name_1 = "Cedric"
print(name_1)

# Variable names cannot contain spaces. We can use underscore to separate the names

total_marks = 100
print(total_marks)

# Variable names are not supposed to be keywords/ reserved characters in python
#for = Nairobi
#print(for)
