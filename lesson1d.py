# Create a python program that is able to calculate the simple interst given the principle as 5000, rate as 5% and time as 8 years. SI= (p * R * t)/1000
principle = 50000
rate = 5
time = 8
simple_interest = (principle * rate * time)/100
print(simple_interest)

  

# Assignment
# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)
# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
# Research on python list, tuple and Dictionary Data types.

# Assignment 1
# BMI = (weight / (height**2))
weight  = 78
height = 1.75
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)
print("BMI is:", BMI )

# Assignment 2

# Area = L * W
width  = 25
length = 48
Area  = width * length
print("Area is:", Area )

# Perimeter = ((L * 2) + (W * 2))
width = 25
length = 48
Perimeter  = ((length * 2) + (width * 2))
print("Perimeter is:", Perimeter)
